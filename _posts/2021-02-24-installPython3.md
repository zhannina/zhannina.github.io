---

Below I have listed instructions of how I installed python3 and PyCharm on my mac. You might find them useful.
Installing Python3 and PyCharm (Instructions for Mac). Although the list looks so long, the steps are very easy and simple to follow.

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Download latest version of Python3 (save the .pkg file locally on your computer)

3. Double click on the downloaded .pkg file and follow installation instructions

4. Once the installation was successfully completed, you can see Python3.9 (or later version) folder in your Applications directory

5. To check if python3 is working on your computer, go to Terminal and type: python3 command

6. This command will display ">>>" in the terminal, which indicates that the terminal is waiting for your python3 commands

7. You can now try printing "Hello world" message by executing the following command:
	 print("Hello world")  

8. You can quit python from terminal by executing the command: 
	quit()

9. At this stage you have installed python on your computers

10. Now we can install an IDE to help us with Python development

11. Go to [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)

12. You will see two links: Professional and Community. Download Community version of PyCharm IDE on your machines (save the .dmg file locally on your computer) for using it for free

13. Double click on the downloaded .dmg file and follow installation instructions (it will ask to drag PyCharm inside the Applications directory. You need to do that)

14. Now PyCharm should be inside your Applications directory, meaning it was installed on your machine

15. Double click on the PyCharm to open the application (it might ask you to agree to the terms and conditions)

16. The it will take you to the three options: "New Project", "Open" and "Get from VCS"

17. Choose "New Project" to start a new project

18. You will see a configuration window where you can specify the location of the project, python interpreter and other details. 

19. For most of the details leave everything as default unless you would want to keep all your python projects in a specific directory. In that case specify the location of the project (the selection box at the top)

20. Check for the base interpreter for PyCharm. By default it should be python3.X (the one you installed previously). In case if the python version is different, you can click on the drop down list and select the latest version of python.

21. Click on the "Create" button and PyCharm will take you to the project enviornment. It might also show you "Tip of the Day" window at the start. You can hide the tips window by selecting "Don't show tips" tick box and closing the window.

22. Voila! You now have your python3 and PyCharm successfully installed and are ready for some python development!
Congratulations!
