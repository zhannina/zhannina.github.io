I have recently attended [OzCHI2017](http://www.ozchi.org/2017/) conference in Brisbane where I presented our paper on [Challenges of Situational Impairments during Interaction with Mobile Devices]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/ozchi_challenges.pdf). We got the Honourable Mention Award for this paper. 
It was also my first experience being a Student Volunteer at a conference.
I really enjoyed working with the SV team and handling the SV duties.
