title: I am now Dr. Sarsenbayeva :)
---
I am so thrilled to announce that I have received my PhD today and I am now officially Dr. Zhanna Sarsenbayeva! :) 
It was an amazing journey and I enjoyed every single moment of it! I am so grateful to my life that it worked exactly this way!
This journey was full of joy, success, happiness, love, fun, exciting trips, surprises, new contacts, connections and opportunities!

I am eternally grateful to my supervisors - [Dr. Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/) and [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/) for guiding me through my PhD with so much wisdom, encouragement, support, kindness, care and concern. I could not have dreamt of better supervisors!
I am also forever grateful to my family and my friends for their tremendous support and always being there for me.

My [Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/239076) is now online and available for open access.
I am now happy to enter the Academic Life being Dr. Sarsenbayeva and look forward to what future holds :)
