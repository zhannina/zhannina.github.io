This year I was again very lucky to attend Ubicomp'19 and present my first-author paper on [Measuring the Effects of Stress on Mobile Interaction](/papers/imwut19.pdf) in London, UK.

The conference was great as usual, I got a chance to meet with my old friends and met new people as well! The reception was held at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) where the Steering Committee held Ubicomp's annual award ceremony. 

It was a great honour for me to be the **winner** of Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award this year for my research contributions and service in the field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. I am now even more inspired to continue doing research and keep the good work up. I am very honoured to win such a prestigious award and thankful for the opportunity to do ubicomp research.

That's not all the good news. We have also won the **Best Paper** Award for the paper that I co-authored - [Assisted Medication Management in Elderly Care Using Miniaturised Near-Infrared Spectroscopy](http://www.jorgegoncalves.com/docs/imwut18a.pdf). This was a great success overall to our lab which I am greatful and lucky to be a part of.

I am now inspired to do more research and looking forward to experience what next unfolds in my life :)
