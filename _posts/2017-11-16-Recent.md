title: My recently developed app
---

I have recently developed an app which can be used to quantify user performance in tapping tasks, searching tasks and typing tasks. Don't worry that the repo is called TypeMe. It was initially created as a repo for a typing task only, but then it grew into a bigger project which combines all of the three 
Please feel free to have a look and fork the [project](https://github.com/zhannina/TypeMe) if needed.
