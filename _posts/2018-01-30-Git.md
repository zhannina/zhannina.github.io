title: Adding an existing project to github
---

I always forget how to add my local projects (on my mac) to [github](https://github.com/).
That's why decided to record the steps here so I remember them in the future. 

So, given that you have an existing project on your machine, 
<ul> the steps are :
<li> 1. Create a github repo on the github website </li>
<li> 2. Copy the URL of the repo </li>
<li> 3. Go to the terminal and navigate to the directory with the project </li>
<li> 4. in the terminal type: git init </li>
<li> 5. then type: git remote add origin /path/to/project-url-on-git </li>
<li> 6. git add . </li>
<li> 7. git commit -m "initial commit" </li>
<li> 8. git push -u origin master </li>
</ul>

That's all needed to set up a git repo for the already existing project. I used to forget adding origin to my repo (step 5), but hopefully not any more.
